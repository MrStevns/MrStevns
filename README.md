Hi and welcome

Since you've come this far, I assume you want to know more about me or what I do.

Here's a bit about myself.
- I currently work as a consultant, in a lead developer/architect role on an iOS app.
- I have worked with code bases that has used architectures such as MVC, MVVM-C, VIPER and recently also a combination of MVVM-C + SwiftUI.
- I prefer working with native applications, be it mobile or desktop.
- I believe in simple solutions over highly generic or too abstracted systems.
- I spend most of my free time on _An easy, intuitive tool to make 2D hand-drawn animations_ called [Pencil 2D](https://github.com/Pencil2D/pencil).

My first language of choice: Swift.
My second language of choice: Odin.

Swift is what I use professionally every day as an iOS app developer. Odin is what I enjoy play around with in my spare time, to scratch that other itch.
I however can and will adapt to whatever is required to complete a given task, as such I also program in C, C++, Python, Bash and Javascript/Typescript when the need arises.
