Hi and welcome

Since you've come this far, I assume you want to know more about me or what i do.

Here's a bit about myself.
- I am an consultant, currently in a lead developer/architect role on an iOS app.
- I have worked on both bigger and smaller apps, with architectures ranging from MVC, MVVM-C, VIPER and recently also a combination of MVVM-C + SwiftUI.
- I prefer working with native applications, be it mobile or desktop.
- I believe in simple solutions over highly generic or too abstracted systems. one _CAN_ have too many abstractions!
- I spend most of my free time on _An easy, intuitive tool to make 2D hand-drawn animations_ called [Pencil 2D](https://github.com/MrStevns/pencil) .

My language of choice: Swift

Why:
- It feels good to write
- It values readability and known programming paradigms.
- The syntax is sane as opposed to other new languages like Rust and Zig.

Other less interesting facts:
- I enjoy old school arcade gaming.
- I'm a metal head.
