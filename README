Hi and welcome

This is where you'll find the projects I work on and contribute to.
My day to day job is being an iOS developer and working with Swift but in my spare time I work with c++. 
I spend most of my time on a animation drawing application called Pencil2D.

I have experience with:
- C++, Swift, Lua, Python, C# (to some extend)
